# Register-based virtual machine

The UTXO model facilitates parallelized transaction execution, enhancing throughput and reducing latency by allowing concurrent processing of non-conflicting transactions. The FuelVM is a **register-based virtual machine**, providing better performance compared to traditional stack-based designs and offering a structured instruction set for efficient operations.
