# [What is Web3?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/web3/#:~:text=Web3%20is%20an%20umbrella%20term,and%20control%20on%20the%20internet.)

**Web3 is an umbrella term for technologies like blockchain that decentralize data ownership and control on the internet**. Most internet applications are controlled by centralized entities that determine how they save and use end-user data. Instead of centralized management structures, Web3 (also called Web 3.0, decentralized web, or semantic web) technologies allow for community-driven projects. In these projects, end users control data, determine pricing, directly contribute to technical development, and have a more significant say in a project's direction. The technologies have mechanisms that automatically regulate how users interact with one another. So, thereâ€™s no requirement for a centralized entity to govern those interactions.
