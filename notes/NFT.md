# What Is a [Non-Fungible Token (NFT)](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211)?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets like artworks, digital content, or videos that have been tokenized via a blockchain. Tokens are unique identification codes created from metadata via an encryption function. These tokens are then stored on a digital ledger, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique.

NFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTsâ€”it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them. For instance, you could draw a smiley face on a banana, take a picture of it (which has metadata attached to it), and tokenize it on a blockchain. Whoever has the private keys to that token owns whatever rights you have assigned to it.

Cryptocurrencies are similar to NFTs, in that both are secured on blockchain networks. The key difference is **cryptocurrencies are fungible**, or interchangeable. While there's no significant difference between one bitcoin and another, **no two NFTs are identical**.
