# [What is Blockchain Sequencer?](https://blockchainubc.ca/what-is-blockchain-sequencer/)

A blockchain sequencer is a specialized component responsible for **determining the order of transactions before they are added to a blockchain**. It collects incoming transactions from the network and organizes them into a sequence according to specific rules. This process is essential because the accuracy of transaction ordering prevents conflicts and helps maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

Sequencers can be found in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, where they exhibit distinct characteristics based on the underlying architecture. In essence, sequencers simplify the task of transaction management, ensuring that nodes can synchronize their data effectively.
